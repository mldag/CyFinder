# CyFinder
Cytoscape is the open source base application, that is used to visualize molecular interaction
networks and it integrates with gene expression profiles. One of the major advantages of
Cytoscape is that additional features are available through available plugins, where features
related to analyzing networks and nodes, new layouts and other options can be added. CyFinder,
the application that is explored in this project, is a plugin for Cytoscape that allows the user to
convert directed graphs into undirected graphs and then perform a search of subgraphs that
match certain criteria.
