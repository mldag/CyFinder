# SubgraphFinder
Subgraph Finder project for CS FIU Students

# NOTE: 
Every time you make changes to anything in the “SubgraphFinder” project which will usually be logical
changes you will have to generate a new jar file in this manner. This jar file is then used as a dependency for
the CyFinder project.
